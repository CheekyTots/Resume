## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

Welcome, fellow lab members, to the digital manifestation of **FUTURE_GADGET_LAB**! This repository hosts the source code for my interactive portfolio, designed to showcase my journey as a **mad scientist** in the realms of Computer Science and Biological Science. Inspired by the captivating world of *Steins;Gate*, this portfolio is more than just a resume; it's a dynamic interface mirroring a research lab, complete with a divergence meter, real-time data feeds, and a personal log.

**Explore the live experiment here:** [https://resume-mg4itih31-ballerforever173888-1860s-projects.vercel.app/]

### Features:

* **Divergence Meter:** Observe the shifting worldlines with a unique, interactive divergence meter.
* **Dynamic Theme:** Toggle between light and dark modes to suit your experimental environment.
* **Terminal-like Interface:** Engage with a simulated terminal for personal insights and system statuses.
* **Real-time API Data:** Fetch and display live weather conditions, philosophical quotes, and even anime recommendations (for those crucial research breaks).
* **Comprehensive Profile:** Dive into my academic background, professional experience, research endeavors, and creative projects, presented with a futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic.
* **Interactive Galleries:** Browse through creative project visuals with intuitive navigation controls.
